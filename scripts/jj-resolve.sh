# jj-resolve.sh — inspect and resolve Jujutsu merge conflicts.
#
# Usage:
#   jj-resolve.sh list              List conflicted files in the working copy.
#   jj-resolve.sh show [<file>]     Show conflict markers for one file (or all).
#   jj-resolve.sh edit <file>       Open $EDITOR on the file. After saving,
#                                   run `mark` to verify resolution.
#   jj-resolve.sh mark <file>       Verify a file is resolved (jj auto-detects
#                                   resolution once conflict markers are gone;
#                                   there is no explicit "mark" command).
#   jj-resolve.sh merge <file>      Launch a 3-way merge tool via `jj resolve`.
#   jj-resolve.sh abort             Abort the in-progress merge/rebase.
#   jj-resolve.sh status            One-line summary: N files conflicted.
#
# This wraps `jj resolve --list` and friends so the agent has a stable,
# documented interface. It does NOT auto-pick a side — conflict resolution
# requires a human or the agent to edit the file deliberately.
#
# Requires: jj.
#
# Conflict marker styles: jj supports three `ui.conflict-marker-style` settings:
#   diff (default) — <<<<<<< / +++++++ / ------- / >>>>>>>
#   snapshot       — <<<<<<< / +++++++ / ------- / >>>>>>>
#   git            — <<<<<<< / ||||||| / ======= / >>>>>>>
# All styles share <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> as start/end. We match all known markers.
